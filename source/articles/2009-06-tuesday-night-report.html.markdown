God is continuing to bless our English Club and Audio Bible Study meetings! Each week people are coming to hear the Word of God. By way of reminder, we hold English Club for the first hour of the evening, follow that with a 5 minute break, and then begin Bible teaching/preaching in Ukrainian for the second hour. The evening ends with tea, snacks, and fellowship.

We have recently been reminded of the power of media in spreading the Word of the Gospel of Christ, and we are encouraged that we now have the book of John, part of the book of Romans, and various topical messages on CD as a result of these weekly meetings.
