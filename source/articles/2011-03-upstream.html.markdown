Last weekend, I had the privilege of speaking at the national Campus Crusade for Christ conference in Vinnystya. Their were about 275 people in attendance from Ukraine and Belarus, as well as few from other countries. The theme of the conference was "Living Upstream". That is, following after Christ (upstream) as opposed to following the world (downstream). The topics were primarily aimed at believers, though I also had many opportunities to present the Gospel to unbelievers. Here's a quick overview of the four sessions I taught, followed by some pictures.

<strong>Session 1: Conformity to Christ</strong>
In this session I spoke about God's universal plan for all believers, conformity to the image of Jesus Christ.

<strong>Session 2: Hearing God</strong>
I spoke about how a believer can hear from God, how to find God's will, etc. The session concluded with a five-point "quickstart guide" to finding receiving direction from God.

<strong>Session 3: Freedom from Sin</strong>
One of my favorite topics. I went over the basics of freedom from sin found in Romans 6 &amp; 8.

<strong>Session 4: Running the Race
</strong>This session was primarily a call to action. I discussed the importance of remaining focused on the race, and serving God through evangelism.

Thanks so much to all of you who prayed for me during the conference. It went very well, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to teach. Also, a very big thank you to Tolik Deminko and his crew for putting the conference together. All I did was show up and talk, but there were many others working very hard behind the scenes to make this event successful. I am confident that the Lord was honored, sinners were challenged to repent, and saints were edified. To God be the Glory!
