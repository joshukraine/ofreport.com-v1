"Nikki" is what we have affectionately dubbed our Nikon D40 camera. Every Tuesday, she goes with us to English Club and Bible study to help document the evening's events. The following are a few of her shots from recent weeks.

God is continuing to bless this ministry--we are building good friendships and people are hearing the gospel preached. Please continue to pray that those who are coming would repent and believe in Christ!

About once a month or so, we have hosted a game night during our English teaching period. The students seem to really enjoy these evenings, and many of our games are new to them. It makes for a nice change of pace, and also helps them break out of their shell and practice more freely.
