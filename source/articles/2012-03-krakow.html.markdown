As the immigration saga continues to unfold, we have become accustomed to experiencing rather dramatic swings in our fortunes. One moment it seems that Ukraine will close its doors forever, and the next we are assured that the acquiring of such-and-such document will be a mere formality.

Happily, it appears that this journey of peaks and valleys is nevertheless leading us in a generally upward direction. Yesterday, our attorney finally received the documents needed in order for us to apply for our new visas at the Ukrainian consulate in Poland. While the battle is far from over, this latest development is certainly encouraging.

All indicators point to a positive outcome and we are optimistic that we will receive our visas that same day.

Then the real battle begins. From that point, we will have 45 days to complete the registration process with our local OVIR in L'viv. While that may sound straightforward, experience has shown it to be anything but. We are grateful to have a good attorney as well as the experience of a few missionaries who have gone before us.

As always, we appreciate your continued intercession for our family and our ministry as we strive to make Christ known in Ukraine.
