<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">CORRECTION</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span> After mailing out the printed version of OFR, we realized that part of the last sentence on page 3 was cut off. The entire sentence should read: *"Whether you support us in prayer or join us in the mountains, help us do what believers have been doing for 2000 years: go and tell others what Jesus Christ has done for you."* This has been corrected in the PDF file below.
