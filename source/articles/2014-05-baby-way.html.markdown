Today, we’re very excited to share with you the news that God has blessed our family with a new member! Kelsie is about ten weeks into her pregnancy, and we expect to welcome our little one into the world sometime in late December.

We appreciate your prayers for our family as we make preparations for the arrival of our baby. We couldn’t be more thrilled, and we praise the Lord for His generous reward.
