Saturday was the second and final day of our Young Men's Conference. Thank you to all of you who were praying about this. We had a great turn out (over 30 guys), and I believe that these young men were encouraged and God was glorified.

Our theme was II Timothy 2. The conference consisted of four sessions, each deriving it's subject from a verse in II Timothy 2. (see topical overview below) All four sessions were recorded on video, and Jonathan Steele is putting them onto a DVD.
