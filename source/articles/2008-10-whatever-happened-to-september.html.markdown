<strong>End of CMO</strong>
The start of September brought the end of our CMO project. We said goodbye to the team of 6 awesome guys who served with us this summer.

With the end of the project, the Steeles have been enjoying a few quieter days.

<strong><!--more-->4th Anniversary!!</strong>
Joshua and I took a 6 day get away trip to Krakow, Poland, over our anniversary!

We camped out at a rock climbing site for the first three days of the trip. The rain ruined most of our climbing plans, but Joshua did get one 70-80 foot climb in!

If you think I was nervous about this climb…well, you’re right! Joshua admitted it was quite a challenging route.

On the night of our anniversary, we ate at a very quaint traditional Polish restaurant. Here we’re trying sausage and quail egg soup in bread bowls.

<strong>Happy 3rd Birthday, Abigail!</strong>
We had a blast doing fun things together on Abigail’s birthday. We opened presents all throughout the day, playing with each one. We even saved some until the following morning! It’s hard to believe our little girl is already three.
