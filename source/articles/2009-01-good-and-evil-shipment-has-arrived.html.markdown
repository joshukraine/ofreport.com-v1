We are very pleased to report that the entire shipment of *Good and Evil* books has arrived at last. On Tuesday morning, we unloaded all four palettes of books in L'viv. We have a growing list of people who have received the short version of G&amp;E, and have requested a full copy. We are thrilled that we can finally begin filling these requests. We believe that God will use this book to draw Ukrainians to Christ.
