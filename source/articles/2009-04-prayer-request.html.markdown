The following letter was given to me by an acquaintance here in L'viv named Taras. It has been translated from Ukrainian.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">*Greetings in the love of our Lord Jesus Christ! Dear brothers and sisters, in this letter I would like to tell you the story of a young Christian family, which is in a very difficult situation. You could say that what happened to them is a tragedy.*</p>

*On October 19, 2008 Dmytro and Lyuba were married. On October 21, 2008, as they were driving home in their car, they had an accident. As they drove along a two-lane road, another car pulled out in front of them illegally. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Dmytro veered left into the opposite lane. Unfortunately, this didn't help [to avoid the collision].*
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">*As a result, Dmytro and Lyuba were badly injured, but survived. Two passengers from the other car died, and two were also badly injured.*</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">*The thoughts of the victims' families are divided. One family has shown forgiveness, understanding Dmytro's innocence. The other family, however, is doing everything in their power to see that Dmytro goes to jail. In addition, both families are suing for material and psychological damages, demanding about 100,000 UAH (approx. $12,500 USD).*</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">*I would like to ask for your prayer support for this young couple. Please consider the situation, and perhaps the Lord would give you a desire to help in a monetary way as well.*</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">*May the Lord bless you all and keep you from similar tragedies.*</p>
